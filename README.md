## EXAMPLES
### unFreeze Me - HID control prevention
Proposal Section | Details
------------ | ----------
*Problem* | Some sites ('web-apps') overwrite standards like CTRL+F, CTRL+C, Right-click, text-selection,.. - This can just be confusing / unexpected or real bad UX making the intention impossible. (And historically many little sites thoughts of preventing copying their text. And some ads sneaked text into clipboards (more reasonable if it is source attributions)
*Solution* |  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hid-control-prevention/ijngdimmjkngoglcjaheoadciaalbafl 
*Side Effects* | site specific use: no unintended side effects.  <br> Also, globally, unfreezing Text-Selection & CTRL+C should be fine on almost every site <br>, while for anybody unfreezing Ctrl+F and Right-click by default, much of the top10000 sites should be whitelisted.  - While a best all  unfreezing/backlisting or whitelisting should be crowdsoured.
*Alternatives* | none. 
*Relevance/Scope* | could have a many users?  besides: <br<  1. Browser extensions as a whole are not popular like apps <br> 2. people tend not to invest a minute to understand something just to save 20 minutes of confusion spread over years? ðŸ¤” (unless they might get a new computer and forget the old setup)   

### YouTube Dislike Count

Proposal Section | Details
------------ | -------------
*Problem* | YouTube hides the number of dislikes, even though dislikes can help me quickly identify some controversial, bad or misunderstood videos.<br> Examples: 1. _________  2. _________ 3. _________   ............
*Scope*  | Maybe a billion people considered this information repeatedly before, so it might be worth it for many of them to individually decide to keep up the "habit" or "declutter."
*Side Effects* | Those video creators might be embarassed/sad about their videos with many dislikes, which can include well reasoned down-votes as well as some kind of silly herd behavior or bullying.
*Context* | [YouTube Official Blog: An update to dislikes on YouTube](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/)
*Solution* | No complete solution besides convincing YouTube to undo.  
*Temporary Solution* | [Archiving the dislike-count from billions of videos](http://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/YouTube#Removal_of_public_video_dislikes_.28December_2021.29) and displaying it in the same familar way [through a browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/).
*Activism / <br>Partial Solution* | The browser extension also counts dislikes of their users, which might allow them to closely guess the future like/dislike-ratio by statistical extrapolation, for those videos where the group of extension users is similarily diverse as YouTube's audience.
*Scope / Limitation of the Partial Solution* | A majority of people voting on YouTube might never have decided to install any browser extensions. However this found a million users within weeks.
