### EXAMPLE

Example proposal: YouTube Dislike Count

Proposal Section | Details
------------ | -------------
*Problem* | YouTube hides the number of dislikes, even though dislikes can help me quickly identify some controversial, bad or misunderstood videos.<br> Examples: 1. _________  2. _________ 3. _________   ............
*Scope*  | Maybe a billion people considered this information repeatedly before, so it might be worth it for many of them to individually decide to keep up the "habit" or "declutter."
*Side Effects* | Those video creators might be embarassed/sad about their videos' many dislikes, which can include serious down-votes as well as some kind of silly herd behavior or bullying.
*Context* | [YouTube Official Blog: An update to dislikes on YouTube](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/)
*Solution* | No complete solution besides convincing YouTube to undo.  
*Temporary Solution* | [Archiving the dislike-count from billions of videos](http://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/YouTube#Removal_of_public_video_dislikes_.28December_2021.29) and displaying it in the same familar way [through a browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/).
*Activism / <br>Partial Solution* | The browser extension also counts dislikes of their users, which might allow them to closely guess the future like/dislike-ratio by extrapolation, for those videos where the group of extension users is similarily diverse as YouTube's audience.
*Scope / Limitation of the Partial Solution* | A majority of people voting on YouTube have not yet decided to install any browser extensions. However this found a million users within weeks.
