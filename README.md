# Wish-Factory

We volunteer to make make helpful apps, sites, browser extensions, plugins, robots, modules, packages & code optimization!), to assist people & save electricty too.

 -  All you need is a real & good wish, to post a [**<code>proposal</code>**](https://github.com/code-charity/Wish-Factory/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Atop) to share / describe that concept.  

     -  Of course we might have to prioritize a lot. However there still are chance a volunteer will help you, even if is far from the biggest causes on the list & unfunded

     -  We use Github's "[discussions](https://github.com/code-charity/Wish-Factory/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Atop)"-section, because it allows sorting by upvotes.  ( _even it doesn't allow bulk-labeling_ )
    
Teamplate Proposal | ( _A concise proposal might includes the following:..._ )
----------- | ----------
*Problem* | Does your idea relate to a problem? Which problem is it? ("One's always reasonably frustrated when...?")
*Solution* |  _if you can imagine one_ - A clear and concise description of what you are looking for. <br> Please add screenshots or sketches if it will help at all.
*Alternatives* | What else did you consider? <br> - All alternative solutions you considered (be they similar, inferior or superior).
*Relevance/Scope* | Would this be good for everybody by default or a whole demographic group?. <br>- Estimate how many (percent of) people should make use of your idea. And how many actually will.
*Side Effects* | Is there any contradiction/conflict with anything?<br>- Who might NOT want this?<br>- How many people might be bothered, if this solution was suggested to them?
*Context* | Any relevant context.

## EXAMPLES 
...
## Two existing browser extensions: 

"unFreeze Me - HID control prevention" | ...
------------ | ----------
*Problem* | Some sites ('web-apps') overwrite standards like CTRL+F, CTRL+C, Right-click, text-selection,.. - This can just be confusing / unexpected or real bad UX making the intention impossible. (And historically many little sites thoughts of preventing copying their text. And some ads sneaked text into clipboards (more reasonable if it is source attributions)
*Solution* |  We are got this already: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hid-control-prevention/ijngdimmjkngoglcjaheoadciaalbafl 
*Relevance/Scope* | "Should have many users" besides: <br> 1. Browser extensions as a whole are not popular like apps 2. Many people might not tend not invest this minute to understand something, just to save and enjoy maybe 1 more hour, but taking years? ðŸ¤” (The "investmented" time is worth it but slowly. And many people might just get a new computer and start all over every other year, forgetting or losing the old setup)  
*Side Effects* | Site- specific use only yet, thus no unintended side effects.  <br> Also, globally, unfreezing Text-Selection & CTRL+C should be fine on almost every site <br>, while for anybody unfreezing Ctrl+F and Right-click by default, much of the top500 (or more) sites can be whitelisted.  - While at best all unfreezing/backlisting or whitelisting on popular sites (maybe on 2000 in 100000) can be through a global blacklist, Crowdsoured and only active by default on unpopular pages. Then the relevance could rise, because it would help automatically.
*Alternatives* | https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/28497-%E7%BD%91%E9%A1%B5%E9%99%90%E5%88%B6%E8%A7%A3%E9%99%A4-%E6%94%B9

"YouTube Dislike Count" | ...
------------ | -------------
*Problem* | YouTube hides the number of dislikes, even though dislikes can help to quickly identify some controversial, bad or misunderstood videos.<br>  Examples: 1. _________  2. _________ 3. _________   ............
*Scope*  | Maybe a billion people considered this information repeatedly before, so it might be worth it for many of them to individually decide to keep up the "habit" or "declutter."
*Side Effects* | (Some video creators might be embarassed/sad about their videos with many dislikes, which can include well reasoned down-votes as well as some kind of silly herd behavior or bullying.)
*Context* | [YouTube Official Blog: An update to dislikes on YouTube](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/)
*Solution* | No complete solution, besides convincing YouTube to undo.  Youtube can activate it again. And let unpopular channels decide themselves. And improve work on bullying. And publish findings what effect this had on then recent ratings. 
*Temporary Solution* | [Archiving the dislike-count from billions of videos](http://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/YouTube#Removal_of_public_video_dislikes_.28December_2021.29) and displaying it in the same familar way [through a browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/).
*Activism / <br>Partial Solution* | The browser extension also counts dislikes of their users, which might allow them to closely guess the future like/dislike-ratio by statistical extrapolation, for those videos where the group of extension users is similarily diverse as YouTube's audience.
*Scope / Limitation of the Partial Solution* | A majority of people voting on YouTube might never have decided to install any browser extensions. However this promisingly found a million users within weeks.
*Alternative* | -
